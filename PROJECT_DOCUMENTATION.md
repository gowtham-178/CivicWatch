  const [token, setToken] = useState(localStorage.getItem('token'));

  const login = async (email, password) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    if (response.ok) {
      setToken(data.token);
      setUser(data.user);
      localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);
    }
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, token, login }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### Backend - Report Controller:

```javascript
// controllers/reportController.js
const getAllReports = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { status, category, page = 1, limit = 10 } = req.query;
    const filter = {};
    if (status) filter.status = status;
    if (category) filter.category = category;

    const reports = await Report.find(filter)
      .populate('category userId')
      .sort({ createdAt: -1 })
      .limit(limit * 1)
      .skip((page - 1) * limit);

    res.json({ success: true, reports });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
};

const createReport = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { title, description, category, location } = req.body;
    const report = new Report({
      title, description, category, location,
      userId: req.user.id, status: 'Pending'
    });
    await report.save();
    res.status(201).json({ success: true, report });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
};
```



### Database Models:

```javascript
// models/report.js
const reportSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 100 },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 1000 },
  category: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Category', required: true },
  location: { type: String, required: true },
